# admin-dashboard
## Admin Dashboard project for The Odin Project

Utilized a mix of CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to create this layout. 

### Things learned:

1. I need to improve my choice of styling selectors. This will likely be the last time I use `<div>` tags and `.class` for like everything. Styling will be easier if I use more `<h>` or `<p>` elements.

2. Grid really does let you build layouts quickly.

3. Grid does a really good job at being responsive on the page, but crossing streams can cause issues (img sizing, flexbox etc.), so I must watchout for that.
