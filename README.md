# admin-dashboard
Admin Dashboard project for The Odin Project

Utilized a mix of CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to create this layout. 

Things learned:
I need to improve my choice of styling selectors. This will likely be the last time I use <div> tags for like everything. Styling will be easier if I use <h> or <p> elements.

Grid really does let you build layouts quickly.

Grid does a really good job at being responsive on the page, but crossing streams can cause issues (img sizing, flexbox etc.), so I must watchout for that.
